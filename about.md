I am a social scientist getting my formal start in data science through the Social Data Analytics & Research (SDAR) master's program at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am also an associate professor of sociology at Collin College in Frisco, TX. My background and training until recently have been in applied social science and qualitative research methods. My experience includes academic research and teaching, policy analysis in state and local government, and market research for small businesses and startups.

This site is a work-in-progress and will serve as a portfolio of my graduate program lab assignments, current projects and other data science activities.

### Interests

My research interests are in neighborhood change, cultural and housing displacement, housing affordability, the suburbanization of poverty and other urban policy issues. I employ methods in data mining, geospatial analysis, machine learning, web scraping, and data visualization in my graduate analysis projects.

My current projects focus on the application of social media data analysis, geographic information science, and machine learning to predict and track gentrification in urban neighborhoods. I am exploring the ways these tools can be leveraged to better inform urban planners, community stakeholders and policymakers about neighborhood change -- with the ultimate goal of preventing or mitigating the harms of gentrification and displacement.

### Skills

Developing skills in: R, Python, Java, GIS, Tableau, SQL

### More Information

Outside of my academic interests, I am also exploring big data analysis and machine learning applications for the industrial hemp industry. I am a hemp farmer and executive of Hawley Hemp Labs, a family-owned and operated industrial hemp producer, processor, and analytical lab based in East Texas. I also lend my research and analysis skills to small businesses and startups seeking to expand their businesses through data-driven planning and marketing strategies.

As a social scientist, I believe that data science is a critical tool to promote social equity and solve pressing social problems. I am an advocate for equitable and ethical data use, and the the use of data science to improve the lives of communities of color and marginalized groups.
